<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="local-agriculture-market-program-lamp">Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP)</h3>
<p>The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers a variety of grant programs aimed at strengthening local and regional food systems. The Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP) is one such program that supports direct producer-to-consumer marketing, food enterprises, and value-added agricultural products. Established under the 2018 Farm Bill, LAMP fosters community collaboration and public-private partnerships to improve regional food economies, aiding in the development of business strategies and infrastructure for local food systems.</p>

<p>According to AMS, the main goals of the LAMP program include the following<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simplify the application processes and the reporting processes for the Program</p></li>
<li><p>Improve income and economic opportunities for producers and food businesses through job creation</p></li>

<p>In 2021, AMS partnered with Florida A&amp;M University and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore on a project focusing on the following goals<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Evaluate barriers to AMS grant opportunities for socially disadvantaged communities</p></li>
<li><p>Invest in building trust and confidence between these communities and the USDA</p></li>
<li><p>Take action to rectify inequalities in program access through targeted outreach, training, and technical assistance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(something here about the history of discrimination in USDA programs, sowing mistrust among these communities, and potential hesitancy to partner with USDA on programs like LAMP.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-characteristics">Community characteristics</h2>
<p>Participation in grant programs supporting investment in local food systems, such as LAMP, is influenced by a variety of socioeconomic and environmental factors that influence local needs, as well as local capacity to apply for grants and manage funded projects. Community wealth, which encompasses social capital, natural capital, financial capital, and a variety of other forms of wealth impacts the ability to engage and participate in such programs.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Moreover, things like poverty and food insecurity rates have been shown to exacerbate vulnerabilities and influence accessibility and participation in programs.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> With food systems-focused programs such as LAMP, urbanization and proximity to agricultural land can influence market dynamics and food system connectivity.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>This report will assess the relationship of each of these community characteristics to the distribution of LAMP grants across the US.</p>
