# FAS Capstone Project 2024
#### Author: Elliot Hohn
#### Online report: https://elhohn.github.io/fas-capstone/
This repostitory has the code and associated files for my capstone project as part of the Food Systems Fellowship with the Federation of American Scientists, completed in May 2024.

This report is built with Quarto (https://quarto.org/) using mostly R, with a sprinkling of Javascript, for the data manipulation and visualization. My approach leans heavily on the {leaflet} package in R (https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for creating interactive maps, as well as a lot of {ggplot2} for plots and {gt} for tables.

Much of the data comes from the CSU Local and Regional Food Systems GitHub repo (https://github.com/CSU-Local-and-Regional-Food-Systems/USDA-AMS-Data-and-Metrics). Additional data came from the USDA Census of Agriculture, accessed using the {tidyUSDA} package, as well as various other publicy-available datasets that are documented within the report.
