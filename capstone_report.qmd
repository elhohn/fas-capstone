## Introduction

### Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP)

The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers a variety of grant programs aimed at strengthening local and regional food systems. The Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP) is one such program that supports direct producer-to-consumer marketing, food enterprises, and value-added agricultural products. Established under the 2018 Farm Bill, LAMP fosters community collaboration and public-private partnerships to improve regional food economies, aiding in the development of business strategies and infrastructure for local food systems.

### Building community capital through food systems investment

#### Theory of Change

According to AMS, the main goals of the LAMP program include the following[^1]:

[^1]: <https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/lamp>. Accessed April 20, 2024

-   Simplify the application processes and the reporting processes for the Program

-   Improve income and economic opportunities for producers and food businesses through job creation

-   Strengthen capacity and regional food system development through community collaboration and expansion of mid-tier value chains

#### Targeting / prioritizing funding

In 2021, AMS partnered with Florida A&M University and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore on a project focusing on the following goals[^2]:

[^2]: <https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/MSDUSDAAMSGrantApplicantTASociallyDisadvantaged.pdf>

1.  Evaluate barriers to AMS grant opportunities for socially disadvantaged communities

2.  Invest in building trust and confidence between these communities and the USDA

3.  Take action to rectify inequalities in program access through targeted outreach, training, and technical assistance.

(something here about the history of discrimination in USDA programs, sowing mistrust among these communities, and potential hesitancy to partner with USDA on programs like LAMP.

### Goal of this project

-   Analyze the data to see if there are relationships between community characteristics and likelihood of receiving LAMP funding

-   Generate actionable insights into improving LAMP grant targeting, identify

### Caveats and such

-   Temporal component -

-   Does not include data on who applied, in addition to who was funded.

### Best practices, current innovation, and policy proposals

(Identify and discuss successful program and policy models, emerging and innovative approaches, or other proposed interventions relevant to the issue area.)

### Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP)

According to the USDA-AMS LAMP webpage, the program's main goals are:

-   Connect and cultivate regional food economies through public-private partnerships.

-   Support the development of business plans, feasibility studies, and strategies for value-added agricultural production and local and regional food system infrastructure.

-   Strengthen capacity and regional food system development through community collaboration and expansion of mid-tier value chains.

-   Improve income and economic opportunities for producers and food businesses through job creation; and

-   Simplify the application processes and the reporting processes for the Program.

AFAIK, USDA does not have great data on the nuanced characteristics of the counties receiving funding. This analysis might shed some light on whether or not there is some threshold level of social capital that determines if a county gets funding.
